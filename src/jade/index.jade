                         p.justify I am a physics PhD candidate and self-taught front-end developer with a true passion for javascript. In parallel with the PhD course, which I will finish in May 2018, I have been developing the necessary skills to make a career out of programming and this strong interest led me to a scholarship given by Google to do their mobile web specialist certification (planed to the end of 2018). In summarize, my background in exact sciences made me a highly trained problem solver and I not only feel ready as I am already breaking through new challenges.
