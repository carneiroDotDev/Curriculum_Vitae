                         p.justify Frontend Developer and PhD in Physics with experience in cross-plataform development using ReactJS and React native. My education in exact sciences made me a highly trained problem solver and I have been aplaying that skill in programming. Javascript is nowadays the language that I feel most comfortable with, however, I am always open-minded for exploring new topics about software engineering.

                         p.justify I am deep diving in ReactJS and its different flavors (Primitives, React Native, NextJS, GatsbyJS) together with the different tools for improving code quality (Typescript, Jest, Styled system). Besides the frontend, I have also been working with Docker and Kubernetes for testing code in containers before sending it to production. Meanwhile, I worked in projects alone, with teams of two to three developers and lately in a multicultural group of fifteen colleagues.

                         p.justify The scholarship was divided in three steps: first a candidates selection, followed by three courses about progressive web applications. The students which completed the courses and had a remarkable contribution to the community, were selected to a nanodegree course through the Udacity platform. After the nanodegree, one may apply to the Google mobile web specialist certification, which I am planing to do in the end of 2018.

                         p.justify The main focus of a PhD course is to transform a master of science into a researcher capable of producing a complete study from scratch until a relevant publication. I have learned and improved many skills along this conversion, as for example: programming, team work and task automation.
