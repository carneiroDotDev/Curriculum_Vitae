# Developer self-disclosure: 
```
I now have two years of professional experience as a software developer, though I have been coding for the last ten years. In this period, I wrote Fortran, Python, IDL, Latex mainly to analyze data, publish results, and complete my Ph.D. Lately, I am focussing on Typescript, which is a typed superset of Javascript.

Professionally,  React Native and React Web have been my playground. I used NextJS to write an AMP website, which was the first product of the company to use end to end tests with Cypress. These days, I am working on a NodeJs project which will be the first company's product with GraphQL. In parallel, I continuously write multiplatform components, meaning code libraries to be used on the web as also on mobile. 

One of the challenges in multiplatform development is to achieve appearance consistency in different environments. It is not only about responsiveness, but the basis that guides style in web and cellphones is different. That leads to Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) problems which sometimes seem senseless. Noting that in my early days as a professional developer, made me focus on the fundamentals of styling applications. That turned out to be very helpful for writing the smallest elements which would then manage the styles depending on where the application is built. It brings also an optimization in development time since the bigger components can handle other complexities but the styling is fixed and centralized.

A couple of months after that, when my department was moving from Javascript to Typescript, we quickly met a time-consuming problem. At some point, some procedures had to be run depending on an object type. In other words, the object's interface had to be verified before the next line of code. As more than one person on the team had the same problem, I was very excited to find a solution. I decided then to read the whole documentation because It was a predictable issue. The complexity solution is called type guards. It skips the scope of this text to explain the solution details. After that happened, I started to read the documentation of technologies before even encountering a problem. There is always at least a minimal new feature to be learned.

In the end, good communication with my teammates was a crucial soft skill that allowed me to understand the problems and find a solution. I keep challenging myself daily to find a way to make conversations between me and my peers always smoother.
